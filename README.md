# Replicat

Configurable and lightweight backup utility with deduplication, encryption and stuff.

## Why doncha just use X?

For various reasons, I wasn't 100% happy with any of the similar projects that I've checked.
Sure, I won't be 100% happy with Replicat either, but at least I'm able to change something in it.

Highlights/goals
  - concise implementation
  - easily extendable and configurable
  - few external dependencies
  - well-documented behaviour
  - unified repository layout
  - modular design
  - API that exists

This project borrows heavily from those other projects, but not enough to be considered
a copycat ðŸ˜‰
